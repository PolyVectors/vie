# vie
a tiny machine code "compiler" that turns `xxd`-style input into an executable ELF binary.

# direction
i want to make this project self-hosting (as in written in machine code and compiled by itself) and possibly expand it into a simple assembler

# usage
```
vie <source> <out>

vie -h
vie --help
```
